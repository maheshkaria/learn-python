# function -> piece of code which needs to be re-used again and again can be put together and used as we need in logical
# representation called as function. A function may or may not take any argument and may or may not return any response.
# Once we define function we need to call that function to execute it.

def my_first_function(): # function defined
    print("hello")

my_first_function() # function call
