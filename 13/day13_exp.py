# First describe bug then think what all, ways it can be produced and then try to come up with solution
# Try to reproduce bug and make long term fix
# If none of them works add break point check with exact inputs and see what is wrong and apply fix
# Evaluating each line is good if project is too big to run limited scope of project
# Debugging skill takes time to build and comes with confidence over a period so give yourself time.
