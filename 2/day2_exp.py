# Data types
# Python offers different primitive data types such string, float, int, boolean etc

print(type("random"))                   # it will show type str aka string
print(type(123))                        # it will show type int aka integer
print(type(123.001))                    # it will show type float
print(type(True))                       # it will show type bool

# Function is something helps to run same code again and again by calling them with distinct name
# print(), len() and type() all of them are some examples of function which we have used so far

a = 123
print("value of a: " + str(a))  # we can type cast variable from any data type to any other data type as shown
